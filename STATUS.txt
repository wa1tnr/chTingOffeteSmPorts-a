Have worked with Ting's system for a while now and have
become a little familiar with its fundmentals.

Current (2176, 62.ino) effort seems to have succeeded - iirc
the claim is now made that the entire program is written
in C++ whereas the earlier one (2174) relied also on a
precompiled ROM image (forming the primary Forth dictionary
for 2174).

Will clang-format 2176 main.cpp soon.  It is therefore still
as Ting wrote it, with necessary edits, and also without the
ctrl m line endings Ting had.

Did a quick check from a fresh clone off the github repo.

Seems fine locally.  Builds and runs as expected.

There's plenty yet to do, but basic Forth functionality
is now present in the program.

The data directory holds additional resources that are
not yet functional here in the present environment.

end.
